# 1. Business Problem.

**The company**
Dirk Rossmann GmbH, with 56,300 employees in Europe and 4,244 stores, including 2,233 in Germany, is one of the largest drugstore chains in Europe. In 2020, the ROSSMANN Group achieved average sales of 10.35 billion euros in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Albania, Kosovo, Spain, and Turkey.
The ROSSMANN range is highly customer-oriented. The product range comprises approximately 21,700 items and varies by store location and size. The average sales area of ​​ROSSMANN drugstores is 590 square meters.
In 2014, a new store image was launched, with warmer colors, new product ranges, an attractive customer orientation system, and lots of indirect light for a more personal approach with the customer.

**The problem**
Implementing store improvements requires well-structured financial planning with a small margin of error, preventing the company from wasting money on implementing the initiatives.
The main difficulty encountered by the CFO was to know how much each store sold and how much would sell in the short term.
Furthermore, there was no easy, automated, standardized way to obtain this information.
Asking managers to forecast each store's sales over the next six weeks meant that each manager would use a different way to get the data, using different approaches, metrics, and variables.

**The solution**
The solution aims to create an intelligent model that uses sales data from all stores and their main characteristics to forecast sales in a future period. A TelegramBot will be used to streamline and facilitate the delivery of information.
